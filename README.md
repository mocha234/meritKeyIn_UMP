### meritKeyIn_UMP

## What is this?
This script save your time for not doing the manual participants' details data entry every time after an event!

# Pre-requisite 
- Laptop/Desktop that runs on Window
- Google Chrome Installed. Or Firefox(see source code and editing accordngly!), but simplicity, Chrome will do
- Python interpreter (see guide on how to install)
- Selenium package(see guide on how to install)

# Disclaimer:
This is not an official script to automate stuff. I just want to make things easier and hoping you DONT'T WASTE TIME on key in those participants' details manually!
I'm not sure if I violated UMP's cyber security's rules(if there is), but I hope I don't!
This is an open-source script, feel free to put up issue or fork it and play around. You can go through the code, I don't take your credentials!
Do "Star" this if you find it useful!
